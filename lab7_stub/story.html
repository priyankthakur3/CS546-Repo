        <h1>Time when we crashed rental cars into each other</h1>

        <main>
            <p>It first week of June 2019, our group was planning to go to water park as it was peak of Summer in India. We had decided to rent out two cars to go to Water Park for chilling out.</p>
            <p>We had split ourself into two groups of 4 people so that everyone can sit more comfortably. Me being in first group we decided to go early to pickup car while remaining people decided to go two stops ahead to collect the car</p>
            <p>We reached car pickup spot, and inspected rental cars for any scratches and dents and started our journey. While taking first turn on round about my Friend ended up buming in to rickshaw and my friend being my friend decided not to stop.</p>
            <p>We reached the pickup point of another car, picked up car and started our journey to water park. Just 100m in to journey, we came to realization the brakes on another car were not working correctly which caused it to rear end into our car at front.</p>
            <p>The funny thing about this incident is we realised no car had started its journey in car rental app. We thought we all are going to be screwed but we all ended up having a great time. </p>
            <p>P.S. No one was injured in this weird incident.</p>
